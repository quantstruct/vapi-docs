1. **New xAI and Inflection AI models**: You can now set `Assistant.model` to use `XAI` (e.g., model `grok-beta`) or `Inflection AI` (e.g., model `inflection_3_pi`) by specifying these providers in your assistant configuration. Specify these providers in `assistant.model`, `call.squad.members.assistant.model`, or `call.squad.members.assistantOverrides.model`.

2. **Integrate Existing Trieve Vector Stores in Your Knowledge Base**: When you create a knowledge base with [`POST /knowledge-base`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Knowledge%20Base/KnowledgeBaseController_create), you can now specify `vectorStoreProviderId` to use an existing vector store from your Trieve account. 

3. **Create Vector Stores with Uploaded Files**: You can first upload files using the [`POST /files`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Files/FileController_create) endpoint, and then use the `fileIds` to specify the IDs of previously uploaded files to create a new Trieve vector store. You can customize how your files are ingested, chunked, then rebalanced to ensure correct knowledge is served by your assistant:

- *Split delimiters*: Specify `splitDelimiters` to control how files are split before chunking (default is `[.!?\n]`).
- *Splits per chunk*: Set `targetSplitsPerChunk` to specify the desired number of splits per chunk when creating a vector store (default is 20 splits per chunk).
- *Chunk rebalancing*: Set `rebalanceChunks` to `true` to evenly distribute remainder splits across chunks when creating a vector store to ensure balanced chunk sizes; for example, 66 splits with `targetSplitsPerChunk` of 20 will result in 3 chunks with 22 splits each.

4. **Customize Search Heuristics**: You can filter or remove search results from your knowledge base:

- *Filter by Score threshold*: Set `scoreThreshold` to filter out chunks during searches based on their score. For cosine similarity, chunks below the threshold are filtered out; for other distance metrics, chunks above the threshold are filtered.
- *Remove stop words*: Set `removeStopWords` to `true` to remove stop words during searches. The stop words list is specified in `server/src/stop-words.txt`, and queries that are entirely stop words will still be preserved.

5. **Updated Analytics Endpoint**: The `/analytics` endpoint has changedâ€”use `GET /analytics` to retrieve analytics data instead of `POST /analytics`.
