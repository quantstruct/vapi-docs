# Changelog â€” 2025-06-22

## Major API Additions

- **Campaigns API**: New endpoints and schemas for managing outbound calling campaigns. This includes campaign lifecycle management (`/campaign`, `/campaign/{id}`), scheduling, customer lists, call statistics, and campaign status tracking. This enables orchestrating large-scale outbound calling via Vapi.
- **Credential Management**: New credential types supported for S3, GCP, Azure, Supabase, and Cloudflare. Each credential now supports fallback order (`fallbackIndex`) for robust artifact upload and storage.
- **New Tool Types**: 
  - **API Request Tool**: Added endpoints and schemas for defining API request tools, including custom function definitions, variable extraction plans, and retry/backoff strategies.
  - **MCP Tool**: Added support for MCP (Model-Controlled Plugin) tools with protocol metadata. Webhook server precedence for tool calls is now well-defined.

## Workflow & Assistant Enhancements

- **Background Speech Denoising**: Assistants and workflows now support advanced background speech denoising via Krisp (Smart Denoising) and experimental Fourier denoising. Both can be enabled and configured independently or together.
- **Transcriber Updates**: Added Cartesia, AssemblyAI, and fallback plans for transcribers, including new configuration options (e.g., `formatTurns`, `maxTurnSilence`, `minEndOfTurnSilenceWhenConfident`).
- **Voice Model Improvements**: LMNTVoice and FallbackLMNTVoice now support language selection and improved fallback logic.
- **AssistantOverrides & WorkflowOverrides**: New properties for granular runtime overrides, including background denoising and credential injection.

## Cost Tracking & Observability

- **Cost Breakdown**: Calls and chats now include detailed cost breakdowns for each component (LLM, STT, TTS, transport, Vapi, analysis, etc.).
- **Langfuse Observability**: Workflows and assistants now support Langfuse for detailed trace and span tracking.

## Minor Improvements & Fixes

- **Compliance & Monitoring**: Workflows and assistants now support compliance plans (HIPAA etc.), monitoring plans for live listening/control, and improved webhook routing.
- **Artifact & Analysis Plans**: New schema properties for storing and configuring artifacts and analysis at both assistant and workflow levels.
- **ServerMessage Updates**: All server and client messages now consistently include `chat` and `call` objects for easier integration.
- **Parameter Extraction**: Variable extraction plans can now be attached to API Request tools, improving structured data extraction from tool results.

## Breaking Changes

- **Removed**: Deprecated properties in Workflow schemas (e.g., `model` at the workflow root level) have been removed. Ensure you use node-level model configuration.

**Upgrade Guidance**:
- Review new credential management and denoising options for enhanced reliability and call quality.
- Update tool and workflow definitions to leverage new API Request and MCP tool capabilities.
- For custom integrations, ensure server endpoints handle new webhook payloads and cost breakdowns.
