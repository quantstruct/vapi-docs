# Changelog â€“ 2025-07-28

## New Features & Enhancements

### Minimax Voice Support
<Check /> **Minimax Voice** is now available as a voice provider for assistants and workflows. Minimax offers:
- Real-time (low-latency) and high-fidelity TTS models (`speech-02-turbo`, `speech-02-hd`).
- Fine-grained control over pitch, speed, volume, and emotion.
- Region selection ("worldwide" or "china").
- Caching and fallback plans for robust voice delivery.

**How to use:**
- Add a `MinimaxVoice` object to your assistant or workflow's `voice` property.
- Configure via the new `CreateMinimaxCredentialDTO` for API key and group ID management.

### Fully Structured Call Hooks
<Check /> **Call hooks** now offer a more robust, event-driven structure for customizing call flows:
- **CallHookCallEnding**, **CallHookAssistantSpeechInterrupted**, **CallHookCustomerSpeechInterrupted**, and **CallHookCustomerSpeechTimeout** provide fine-grained control over actions triggered by call events.
- Hooks can be attached at the workflow, assistant, or node level, with advanced filtering using `CallHookFilter`.
- Say and tool call actions are now more flexible with `SayHookAction` and `ToolCallHookAction`.

**Benefits:**
- Enable advanced automation, e.g., trigger a webhook or say a custom message when a customer is silent for too long.
- Compose complex flows by combining multiple hooks and filters.

### Expanded Model and Credential Support
<Check /> **Minimax** is now supported as a credential provider for both assistants and workflows. Add Minimax credentials for seamless integration with the new voice provider.

### Enhanced Conversation Node Tooling
<Check /> **Conversation nodes** in workflows now support specifying `tools` and `toolIds`, allowing you to assign tools directly at the node level for more modular and context-specific actions.

### Pronunciation Dictionary Integration
<Check /> **ElevenLabs Voice** now supports custom pronunciation dictionaries via `pronunciationDictionaryLocators`, enabling precise control over speech output.

### Azure Speech Transcriber Segmentation
<Check /> The **AzureSpeechTranscriber** now supports advanced segmentation options:
- `segmentationStrategy`, `segmentationMaxTimeMs`, and `segmentationSilenceTimeoutMs` allow you to fine-tune phrase boundary detection and pause sensitivity.

## Deprecations & Removals

### Tool DTO and Function Property Cleanup
<Card type="warning">
The `function` property has been **removed** from all tool DTOs (e.g., `CreateMcpToolDTO`, `CreateBashToolDTO`, etc.). Use the new hook/action system for tool invocation logic.
</Card>

### Legacy Hook and Filter Types
<Card type="warning">
Legacy hook types (`AssistantHookCallEnding`, `AssistantHookCustomerSpeechInterrupted`, etc.) have been **replaced** by the new `CallHook*` types. Please update your integrations to use the new event-driven hook structure.
</Card>

### API Path and Property Removals
- Several discriminator mappings for tool endpoints have been removed from OpenAPI paths. If you were relying on these, please review the new tool registration and invocation workflow.
- The deprecated `silenceTimeoutSeconds` property has been removed from assistants and related DTOs. Use the new `CustomerSpeechTimeoutOptions` in hooks.

---

## Other Improvements
- Workflow and assistant schemas now explicitly support `messagePlan.deprecated` as a marker for legacy message plans.
- Enhanced support for event-driven automation in both API and workflow schemas.
- Improved clarity and separation between workflow-level and node-level configuration for models, tools, and hooks.

**Upgrade Guidance:**
- Migrate any legacy hooks and tool function properties to the new structured hooks and actions system.
- For voice features, explore Minimax and ElevenLabs pronunciation dictionary support for advanced TTS customization.
- Review the new segmentation options for Azure Speech Transcriber if you require advanced control over speech phrase boundaries.
