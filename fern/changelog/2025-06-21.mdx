# 2025-06-21 Changelog

## Major Breaking Changes

### Removal of Assistant, Tool, and Chat Schema Properties
- Numerous properties and schema paths have been **removed** from the API, including many related to `Assistant`, `AssistantOverrides`, `Chat`, `Workflow`, `Credential` types, and various `ServerMessage*` objects. This includes:
  - Removal of background denoising and speech denoising plans from assistants and workflows
  - Removal of several properties from credential objects (e.g., fallbackIndex, region)
  - Significant reduction in `chat`-related properties from server message schemas
  - Removal of API Request Tool discriminator mappings from multiple endpoints
  - Removal of variable extraction plan, name patterns, and other properties from tool creation

> **Action Required:**
> - If your integration relies on any of the removed properties or schemas, update your code to avoid referencing them. Calls using deprecated fields will now fail validation.

### AssemblyAITranscriber and FallbackAssemblyAITranscriber
- The following properties were **removed**: `formatTurns`, `maxTurnSilence`, `wordFinalizationMaxWaitTime`, `endOfTurnConfidenceThreshold`, `minEndOfTurnSilenceWhenConfident`.

## Additions

### Workflow Enhancements
- New schema properties and definitions have been **added** for Workflows:
  - `Workflow.model`: Now supports specifying a model at the workflow level. Accepts `WorkflowOpenAIModel` or `WorkflowAnthropicModel`.
  - New edge condition types: `LogicEdgeCondition` and `FailedEdgeCondition` are now supported in workflow edges. `LogicEdgeCondition` uses a `liquid` template string for advanced branching.

> **For Developers:**
> - You can now specify a model for the entire workflow, providing greater flexibility and control over LLM selection.
> - Use `LogicEdgeCondition` for complex, liquid-based conditional branching in workflow edges.

## Migration Guidance
- Review all usage of removed properties and schemas, especially if you use advanced assistant, tool, or workflow customization features.
- Migrate workflow branching logic to use the new `LogicEdgeCondition` and `FailedEdgeCondition` schemas where applicable.
- Update your workflow definitions to optionally include the new `model` property for global LLM configuration.
