<Check /> **Transcription Segmentation Improvements for AzureSpeechTranscriber**
</Card>

- **Enhanced Segmentation Control:**
  - The `AzureSpeechTranscriber` and `FallbackAzureSpeechTranscriber` schemas now support the new property `segmentationMaximumTimeMs`, allowing you to set the maximum segment duration for time-based transcription segmentation (range: 20,000â€“70,000 ms). This enables more precise control over how long a phrase can be before it is cut off, improving transcript accuracy for long utterances.
  - The previous property `segmentationMaxTimeMs` has been **removed**. Please update your integrations to use `segmentationMaximumTimeMs` instead.

- **Cleaner Assistant Schema:**
  - Deprecated properties and paths related to `messagePlan` and `backgroundDenoisingEnabled` have been removed from the `Assistant`, `AssistantOverrides`, `CreateAssistantDTO`, and `UpdateAssistantDTO` schemas. This streamlines the assistant configuration and eliminates unused options.

- **Path Cleanup:**
  - Several legacy or redundant schema paths related to `assistant`, `assistantOverrides`, and transcriber configuration have been removed for clarity and maintainability.

**Migration Guidance:**
- If you previously used `segmentationMaxTimeMs`, update to `segmentationMaximumTimeMs`.
- Review your assistant configurations to remove references to `messagePlan` and `backgroundDenoisingEnabled`.

**Full details:**
- `segmentationMaximumTimeMs` is now the only supported way to control max segment duration for Azure-based transcription.
- Paths and properties referencing deprecated assistant features have been fully removed.
- No breaking changes to endpoint structure, but some request/response shapes may be simplified.
